# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Price-Prediction

A predictive analysis project to estimate resale flat prices in Singapore using various Regression Models. 

This repository includes:
1. Linear Regression 
2. Polynomial Regression 
3. Ridge Regression
4. Decision Tree Regression 
5. Data Visualization 

## About each notebook

### Linear Regression 
In this notebook, a Mathematical model was first used to perform the prediction and the results are then compared to the Linear Regression model from sklearn.

### Polynomial Regression
In this notebook, polynomial models of different orders are used to perform the prediction. 

### Ridge Regression
In this notebook, a Ridge Regression model (with alpha= 1) from sklearn was used to perform the prediction.

### Decision Tree Regression
In this notebook, the Decision Tree Regression model (with optimised max_depth and min_samples_split) from sklearn was used to perform the prediction.

### Data Visualization
In this notebook, bar charts were used to visualize the counts of each categories (town, flat type, storey range, flat model, lease commence date) and box-and-whiskers plots were used to visualize the spread of floor area data and resale price (target).
